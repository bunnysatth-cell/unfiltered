  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective Date: January 5, 2026</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Unfiltered</strong> (“Unfiltered”, “we”, “us”, or “our”)
      collects, uses, and protects information when you use our web-based creator tool (the “Service”).
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>a) Information from TikTok</h3>
    <p>
      When you connect your TikTok account through TikTok’s official authorization (OAuth) process,
      we may receive limited information permitted by the scopes you approve, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic profile information (e.g., user ID, display name, profile image)</li>
      <li>Authorization tokens required to upload or publish content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not receive your TikTok password and cannot access information beyond the permissions you grant.
    </p>

    <h3>b) Content You Provide</h3>
    <p>
      We temporarily process video files, captions, and metadata that you choose to upload or publish
      through the Service for the sole purpose of delivering the requested functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>c) Technical Information</h3>
    <p>
      We may collect limited technical data such as IP address, browser type, and timestamps for
      security, debugging, and operational purposes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate your account via TikTok OAuth</li>
      <li>Upload or publish content to TikTok at your request</li>
      <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the Service</li>
      <li>Ensure security and prevent abuse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not use your data for advertising or sell personal information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Unfiltered does not permanently store TikTok credentials or video content beyond what is
      reasonably necessary to perform the requested actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authorization tokens may be stored securely for as long as required to provide the Service
      and can be revoked by you at any time through TikTok.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or rent personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data may be shared only with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>TikTok, as required to perform authorized uploads or publishing</li>
      <li>Service providers that support infrastructure, automation, or hosting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All third-party providers are required to handle data securely and only for service delivery.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      The Service integrates with third-party platforms such as TikTok.
      Your use of those platforms is governed by their own privacy policies and terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfiltered is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information
      against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You may revoke TikTok authorization at any time via your TikTok account settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discontinuing use of the Service will stop further data processing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      Continued use of the Service after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
