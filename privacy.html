  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Unfiltered (“Unfiltered”, “we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use our tool.
    Unfiltered is a web-based creator tool that uses TikTok OAuth and TikTok APIs to help users upload and publish content.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Information we collect</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to minimize data collection. Depending on how you deploy/operate Unfiltered (for example, through automation tools
    like n8n or hosting providers), the following information may be processed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>TikTok authorization data:</strong> OAuth authorization codes and access tokens needed to perform actions you authorize.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic TikTok account info (if requested by scope):</strong> such as display name, open_id, and avatar URL.</li>
    <li><strong>Content metadata:</strong> video filename, caption, hashtags, and publish settings you provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational logs:</strong> timestamps, request IDs, error logs, IP address and user-agent (typical server logs).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate you via TikTok OAuth and confirm permissions</li>
    <li>To upload/publish videos or create drafts on TikTok as you direct</li>
    <li>To troubleshoot issues, prevent abuse, and maintain system security</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations and platform requirements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Where data is stored</h2>
  <p>
    Unfiltered itself is designed to operate with minimal storage. In many setups, tokens and logs may be stored within your
    own automation environment (e.g., n8n) or hosting provider. If you self-host Unfiltered, you control where data resides.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Sharing of information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. Information may be shared only:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With TikTok</strong> to perform API actions you authorize</li>
    <li><strong>With service providers</strong> you use to run Unfiltered (hosting, automation, logging), under their terms</li>
    <li><strong>For legal/safety reasons</strong> if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above. OAuth tokens may persist until they expire or
    you revoke access. Logs, if enabled, are typically retained for a limited period for debugging and security.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information, including limiting access and using secure transport (HTTPS) where possible.
    However, no system is 100% secure. You are responsible for securing your own environment if you self-host.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Your choices and controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke Unfiltered’s access in TikTok settings (OAuth revocation)</li>
    <li>You can stop using Unfiltered at any time</li>
    <li>If you self-host, you can delete stored tokens/logs from your environment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Unfiltered is not intended for children and should not be used by anyone under the age required to use TikTok in their region.
  </p>

  <h2>9) International users</h2>
  <p>
    If you access Unfiltered from outside the region where it’s hosted, your information may be processed in other countries
    depending on your hosting/automation setup.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” above will reflect the latest revision.
