## What Unfiltered Does

Unfiltered helps creators streamline the process of uploading and publishing videos to their own TikTok accounts.

Key capabilities include:

- Connecting a TikTok account via official OAuth authorization
- Uploading video content as drafts or publishing content to TikTok
- Managing captions and metadata where supported
- Providing a simple web-based interface for content publishing workflows

All actions are user-initiated and require explicit authorization.

Unfiltered integrates with TikTok using TikTok for Developers APIs, including:

- Login Kit (OAuth authorization)
- Content Posting API (video upload and publish)

The application only requests the permissions necessary to perform authorized actions.
TikTok credentials and passwords are never collected or stored by this project.

Users may revoke access at any time through their TikTok account settings.
